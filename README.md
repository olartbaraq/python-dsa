# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

Welcome to this repository! Here, you will find my ongoing journey to master data structures and algorithms using Python. I have divided this repository into three sections: Basic Data Structures, Intermediate Data Structures, and Advanced Data Structures & Algorithms. 

The README for each section contains an explanation of the topic and links to relevant resources. Additionally, I have provided my Python code implementations of each topic in a corresponding folder.

## Structure

1. Basic Data Structures
   - Lists
   - Tuples
   - Sets
   - Dictionaries

2. Intermediate Data Structures
   - Linked Lists
   - Stacks
   - Queues
   - Trees
   - Graphs

3. Advanced Data Structures & Algorithms
   - Sorting Algorithms
   - Searching Algorithms
   - Recursion
   - Dynamic Programming
   - Greedy Algorithms
   - Backtracking
   - Bit Manipulation
   - Hashing
   - Heap Data Structure

Please note that this repository is a work in progress and more topics will be added in the future. Feel free to contribute or suggest improvements!
